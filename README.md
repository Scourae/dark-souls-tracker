# Dark Souls Tracker Online App

###This app:
* Stores your progress on area cleared and bosses, mini-bosses killed
* Reminder beside the map on whihc bosses and mini-bosses that are still alive in an area that you have cleared

Make sure your cookies are enabled for this app to save your progress.

Some bosses are on the reminder list but their area is not on the map, that is because the map asset that I have obtained does not have these areas, so they are on the reminder list to remind you that you have to kill them!


Appearance may or may not be improved, new features may be added if I can think of any.
